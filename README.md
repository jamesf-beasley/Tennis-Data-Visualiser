Tennis Player Data Visualiser


Project Description
The Tennis Data Visualizer is a web application created to allow users to analyse and visualise tennis players' performance data. By offering an interface for exploring match statistics, it allows users to gain insights into different trends over time, involving multiple differing key metrics. This project aims to provide a fans of tennis with a different/informative outlook on the players they know well, showing patterns that they may not have seen without.


Challenges and Future Features
Challenge: Collecting and processing large amounts of data in a manner that allows for fast visualisation.
Future Features: Upgrading/fixing the match winner predictional model, and making code more concise in order to increase loading speeds/overall efficiency.
